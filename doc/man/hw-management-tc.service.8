.SH NAME
hw-management-tc.service \- service used to run hw_management_thermal_control.py
.SH SYNOPSIS
Thermal control for NVIDIA systems.
The thermal control service provides advanced thermal management for NVIDIA switch systems.
It implements the Optimized Thermal Monitoring Algorithm (OTMA) that periodically
re-calculates the highest temperature score of all thermal zones and enforces thermal
control following the thermal zone with the highest score.

The service supports multiple thermal control versions:
- TC v2.0: Standard thermal control implementation
- TC v2.5: Enhanced thermal control with improved algorithms for newer systems

The service automatically selects the appropriate thermal control version based on
the hardware platform and runs the corresponding Python script:
- /usr/bin/hw_management_thermal_control.py (TC v2.0)
- /usr/bin/hw_management_thermal_control_2_5.py (TC v2.5)
.SH OPTIONS
