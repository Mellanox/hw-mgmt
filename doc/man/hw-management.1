.SH NAME
hw-management.sh \- Chassis management for Mellanox systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
Mellanox hw-management package uses a virtual file system provided by the Linux kernel
called sysfs.
The sysfs file system enumerates the devices and buses attached to the system in a file
system hierarchy that can be accessed from the user space.
The major advantage of working with sysfs is that it makes HW hierarchy easy to understand
and control without having to learn about HW component location and the buses through
which they are connected.
