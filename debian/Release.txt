 - Known issues and limitations:

    o Systems like sn2700 which contain delta 460 PSU may have "Error getting sensor data: dps460/#25: Can't read"
      which is a temporary inaccessibility of certain alarm attributes read from the PSU.

       patches 5.10: 
		0171-platform-mellanox-mlxreg-lc-Fix-cleanup-on-failure-a.patch

    o  SN27002: when performing hw-mgmt stop start quickly – minimal driver is late to close down (due slow I2C freq) causing ASIC transaction failure.
    o  SN2201: gpio related modules not working properly (e.g. JTAG, FAN’s LEDs) due to GPIO controller starting at different base address for different kernels.
    o  SN2201: CORE temperature report appearing in alternating CORE IDs due Intel Denverton CPU having non consistent CORE ID numbering 
    o  SN2201: emc2305 was capable of changing fan speed only via PWM and not via changing cooling_state.
