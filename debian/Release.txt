-Wed, 24 Mar 2021
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Bug fixes
    o	hw-mgmt: thermal: Add hardcoded critical trip point.
	Follow-up after patch "Removing critical thermal zones to prevent unexpected software system shutdown".

    o   Fix sensor attribute mapping to be label based instead of index based to allow common handling of
	voltage regulator names independently of hardware changes.

    o  	Update 'lm-sensors' custom configuation file.
	Relevant only for users utilizing sensors.conf files coming along with hw-management package.

- Known issues and limitations:
    o This version disables system reset in thermal algorithm
    o   Kernel patch 4.9  #60 is available upstream from kernel 4.9.207 and
        Kernel patch 4.19 #28 is available upstream from kernel 4.19.89.
        - No need to apply these patches when working with these kernel versions
          or above
    o  ethtool for QSFP-DD is working only in raw mode.
    o  SN4700 PSU (Murata) sensors PSU2 and PSU3 might be not available after insertion/removal.
    o  PSUs inventory read via PMBus require the following packages:
        - i2c-tools_4.1-1_amd64.deb
        - libi2c0_4.1-1_amd64.deb
    o  I2C Asic driver take up to 5 second to complete initialization. When
	sending ADD even need to make sure to wait at list 5 second before
	reset of ASIC.
    o   Systems SN2010, SN2100, SN2410, SN2700 and SN2740 (and their
        "-B" variants) require the following flag in kernel cmdline:
        "acpi_enforce_resources=lax acpi=noirq".
    o   Few bug fixes introduced in upstream kernel 4.19, whoever use older
        v4.19 kernel then v4.19.58, should cherry pick the following commits:
        - Fix wrong order in probing routine initialization:
            d2d8f64012543898a0158b1fc5c07af3d41c89d8 (available in v4.19.49)
        - Fix parent device in i2c-mux-reg device registration
            c241f3fbfa1af86f572a92f2e4d708358e163806 (available in v4.19.58)
    o   Kernel patch 4.9  #37 is available upstream from kernel 4.9.197 and
        Kernel patch 4.19 #09 is available upstream from kernel 4.19.79.
        - No need to apply these patches when working with these kernel versions
          or above
    o   This version requires FW version 29.2000.1886 or higher for spectrum-2
	and  13.2000.1886 or higher for spectrum-1.
