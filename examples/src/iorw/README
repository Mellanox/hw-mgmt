    iorw utility provides command access to IO memory CPLD registers.

- Usage:
    iorw -r/w [-b <base_addr>] [-o <offset>] [-l <len>] [-v <value>] [-f <filename>] [-F] [-q] [-h]
    r - read or w -write option should be provided
    b - base_addr, can be omitted, default: 0x2500o - offset, can be omitted, default: 0
    l - length, can be omitted only in read - full dump in this case
    v - value for write operation
    f - file to store output values
    F - force, don't check region ranges
    q - quiet, can be used only with f option, store in file without print
    h - this help

    iorw -r -b 0x2500 -l 300      - prints free first bytes of CPLD version.
    iorw -w -b 0x25db -l 1 -v 8    - open I2C mux leg 8.
