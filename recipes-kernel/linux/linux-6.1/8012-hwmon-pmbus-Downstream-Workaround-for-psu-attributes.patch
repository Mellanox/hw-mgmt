Subject: hwmon: pmbus: Downstream: Workaround for psu attributes

Starting from kernel 5.12.rc-1, pmbus reads are always
forced down to chip and get the values directly. Driver
doesn't cache the values anymore.

This behviour change has caused problems in Delta-1.1K
PSUs, on which pmbus registers were not written.

This patch introduces the driver caching.
