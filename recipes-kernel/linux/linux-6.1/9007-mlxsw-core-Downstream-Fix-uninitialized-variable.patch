Subject: [PATCH hw-mgmt 1/1] mlxsw: core: Downstream: Fix uninitialized
 variable
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Set variable "status" to zero in function mlxsw_cmd_exec() to prevent
garbage value to be passed from underling functions.

In case of transaction failure due to some hardware problem,
uninitialized 'status' may be returned with some garbage value.
This garbage can be interpreted as some special status, like
MLXSW_CMD_STATUS_FW_ISSU (0x27) or MLXSW_CMD_STATUS_RUNNING_RESET
(0x26).
Such codes are considered by the driver as a special flow, which is
ended up with driver removing.
When such code is received - all the next transactions to ASIC are
blocked.

In case this code is received unintentionally, driver will stop control
PWM and stop monitor ASIC and receiversâ€™ sensors and system may end up
with thermal shutdown.
