Subject: [PATH backport v6.1 31/32] Documentation/ABI: Add new attribute for
 mlxreg-io sysfs interfaces

Upstream commit: [e7210563432a6c6fa65a9c5c11ece2a0adbeeda2]

Add description for new attributes added for rack manager switch and
NG800 family systems.

Attributes related to power converter board:
- reset_pwr_converter_fail;
- pwr_converter_prog_en;
Attributes related to External Root of Trust (EROT) devices recovery:
- erot1_ap_reset;
- erot2_ap_reset;
- erot1_recovery;
- erot2_recovery;
- erot1_reset;
- erot2_reset;
- erot1_wp;
- erot2_wp;
- spi_chnl_select;
Attributes related to clock board failures and recovery:
- clk_brd1_boot_fail;
- clk_brd2_boot_fail;
- clk_brd_fail;
- clk_brd_prog_en;
Attributes related to power failures:
- reset_ac_ok_fail;
- asic_pg_fail;

+Description:	These files aim to monitor the status of the External Root of Trust (EROT)
+		processor's RESET output to the Application Processor (AP).
+		By reading this file, could be determined if the EROT has invalidated or
+		revoked AP Firmware, at which point it will hold the AP in RESET until a
+		valid firmware is loaded. This protects the AP from running an
+		unauthorized firmware. In the normal flow, the AP reset should be released
+		after the EROT validates the integrity of the FW, and it should be done so
+		as quickly as possible so that the AP boots before the CPU starts to
+		communicate to each ASIC.

+Description:	These files aim to perform External Root of Trust (EROT) recovery
+		sequence after EROT device failure.
+		These EROT devices protect ASICs from unauthorized access and in normal
+		flow their reset should be released with system power â€“ earliest power
+		up stage, so that EROTs can begin boot and authentication process before
+		CPU starts to communicate to ASICs.
+		Issuing a reset to the EROT while asserting the recovery signal will cause
+		the EROT Application Processor to enter recovery mode so that the EROT FW
+		can be updated/recovered.
+		For reset/recovery the related file should be toggled by 1/0.
