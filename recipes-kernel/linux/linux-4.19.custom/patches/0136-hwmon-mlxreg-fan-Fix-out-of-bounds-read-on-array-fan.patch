Subject: [PATCH backport for v4.19 5/6] hwmon: (mlxreg-fan): Fix out of bounds
 read on array fan->pwm

Array fan->pwm[] is MLXREG_FAN_MAX_PWM elements in size, however
the for-loop has a off-by-one error causing index i to be out of
range causing an out of bounds read on the array. Fix this by
replacing the <= operator with < in the for-loop.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Out-of-bounds read")
Fixes: 35edbaab3bbf ("hwmon: (mlxreg-fan) Extend driver to support multiply cooling devices")
