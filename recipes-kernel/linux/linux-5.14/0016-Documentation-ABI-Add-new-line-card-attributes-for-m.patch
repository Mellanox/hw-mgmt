Subject: [PATCH backport 5.10 016/197] Documentation/ABI: Add new line card
 attributes for mlxreg-io sysfs interfaces

Add documentation for the new attributes for line cards:
- CPLDs versioning.
- Write protection control for 'nvram' devices.
- Line card reset reasons.
- Enabling burning of FPGA and CPLDs.
- Enabling burning of FPGA and gearbox SPI flashes,
- Enabling power of whole line card.
- Enabling power of QSFP ports equipped on line card.
- The maximum powered required for line card feeding.
- Line card configuration Id.

+		the above causes could be 1 at the same time, representing only last
+		reset cause.
