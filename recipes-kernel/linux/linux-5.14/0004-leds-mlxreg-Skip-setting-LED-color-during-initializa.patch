Subject: [PATCH backport 5.10 004/197] leds: mlxreg: Skip setting LED color
 during initialization

Hardware controls LED through CPLD device and LED control ownership
passes to the software after it performs the first write operation for
any LED on a system.
For example, hardware sets "system" LED "green blink" during boot and
might change it to "red", in case something is went wrong from hardware
point of view.
The motivation for not setting LED during kernel initialization is for
keeping hardware settings visible for user, until user will not decide
to set LEDs according to user OS specific requirements.
