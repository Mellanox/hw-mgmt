Subject: [PATCH backport 5.10 34/63] UBUNTU: SAUCE: Fix OOB handling RX
 packets in heavy traffic

BugLink: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1982424

This is reproducible on systems which already have heavy background
traffic. On top of that, the user issues one of the 2 docker pulls below:
docker pull nvcr.io/ea-doca-hbn/hbn/hbn:latest
OR
docker pull gitlab-master.nvidia.com:5005/dl/dgx/tritonserver:22.02-py3-qa

The second one is a very large container (17GB)

When they run docker pull, the OOB interface stops being pingable,
the docker pull is interrupted for a very long time (>3mn) or
times out.

The main reason for the above is because RX PI = RX CI. I have verified that
by reading RX_CQE_PACKET_CI and RX_WQE_PI. This means the WQEs are full and
HW has nowhere else to put the RX packets.

I believe there is a race condition after SW receives a RX interrupt,
and the interrupt is disabled. I believe HW still tries to add RX
packets to the RX WQEs. So we need to stop the RX traffic by disabling
the DMA. Also, move reading the RX CI before writing the increased value
of RX PI to MLXBF_GIGE_RX_WQE_PI. Normally RX PI should always be > RX CI.
I suspect that when entering mlxbf_gige_rx_packet, for example we have:
MLXBF_GIGE_RX_WQE_PI = 128
RX_CQE_PACKET_CI = 128
(128 being the max size of the WQE)

Then this code will make MLXBF_GIGE_RX_WQE_PI = 129:
rx_pi++;
/* Ensure completion of all writes before notifying HW of replenish */
wmb();
writeq(rx_pi, priv->base + MLXBF_GIGE_RX_WQE_PI);

which means HW has one more slot to populate and in that time span, the HW
populates that WQE and increases the RX_CQE_PACKET_CI = 129.

Then this code is subject to a race condition:

rx_ci = readq(priv->base + MLXBF_GIGE_RX_CQE_PACKET_CI);
rx_ci_rem = rx_ci % priv->rx_q_entries;
return rx_pi_rem != rx_ci_rem;

because rx_pi_rem will be equal to rx_ci_rem.
so remaining_pkts will be 0 and we will exit mlxbf_gige_poll
