Subject: [PATCH v1 1/1] e1000e: skip NVM checksum.

NVM checksum is reported as bad in many cases after full
BIOS SPI flash including GbE section burn by Dediprog.
This happened in the early steps of production flow before
EEPROM / NVM info will be customized and the checksum will
be recalculated. Just skip this check.
