Subject: [PATCH 6/6] Documentation/ABI: Add new attributes for mlxreg-io sysfs
 interfaces

Add documentation for the new attributes:
- "phy_reset" - Reset PHY.
- "mac_reset" - Reset MAC.
- "qsfp_pwr_good" - The power status of QSFP ports.

 Description:    This file allows to unlock ASIC after shutdown event.
-        When system thermal shutdown is enforced by ASIC, ASIC
-        is getting locked and after system boot it will not be
-        available. Software can decide to unlock it by setting
-        this attribute to 1 and then perform system power cycle
-        by setting “pwr_cycle” attribute to 1 (power cycle of
-        main power domain).
-        Prior setting “thshtdwn_unlock” 1 it is recommended to
-        validate that system reboot cause is “reset_asic_thermal”
-        In case “thshtdwn_unlock” is not set 1, the only way to
-        release ASIC from locking - is full system power cycle
-        through the external power distribution unit.
