Subject: [PATCH mlxsw/backport 2/2] mlxsw: core: Add validation of transceiver
 temperature thresholds

Validate thresholds to avoid a single failure due to some transceiver
unreliability. Ignore the readouts last in case alarm temperature is
above warning temperature, since it can cause unexpected thermal
shutdown. Stay with the previous values and refresh threshold within
the next loop.

This is the rarest scenario, but somehow once it has been observed at a
customer site.

Fixes: 6a79507cfe94 ("mlxsw: core: Extend thermal module with per QSFP module thermal zones")
