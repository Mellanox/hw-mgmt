Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: mlx-platform: Add support for systems equipped
 with two ASICs

Motivation is to support new systems equipped with two ASICs.
Changes includes support for:
- the second ASIC;
- thermal events for both ASICs, including ASIC thermal warning and critical events.
- reset control for both ASICs, triggering reset of ASIC internal resources and
  restarting ASIC initialization flow.

New systems reuse the existing system class "VMOD0010".

+Description:    This file allows to unlock ASIC after shutdown event.
+        When system thermal shutdown is enforced by ASIC, ASIC
+        is getting locked and after system boot it will not be
+        available. Software can decide to unlock it by setting
+        this attribute to 1 and then perform system power cycle
+        by setting “pwr_cycle” attribute to 1 (power cycle of
+        main power domain).
+        Prior setting “thshtdwn_unlock” 1 it is recommended to
+        validate that system reboot cause is “reset_asic_thermal”
+        In case “thshtdwn_unlock” is not set 1, the only way to
+        release ASIC from locking - is full system power cycle
+        through the external power distribution unit.
